@todo
different precisions
@endtodo

@todo
do a total cross section calculation, since that's relatively easy to do
(and you've done it before)
remember: 
 - clean code
 - TDD
keep in mind (maybe do a bit later)
 - OOP if possible
 - function pointers? e.g. in case we want something other than Lenard-Jones
For this part, I will largely refer to *Computational Physics* by Thijssen.

@todo
extend to partial cross section

You could always just add a note to the readme saying install this thing first since itâ€™s a hack job. Then deal with embedding the lib in the repo later
spent way too much time on trying to embed it, not worth it!
@endtodo

@todo
do a total cross section calculation, since that's relatively easy to do
(and you've done it before)
remember:
 - clean code
 - TDD
keep in mind (maybe do a bit later)
 - OOP if possible
 - function pointers? e.g. in case we want something other than Lenard-Jones
For this part, I will largely refer to *Computational Physics* by Thijssen.

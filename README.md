# scatter

Quantum scattering, and (eventually) loss rate calculations for elastic collisions. 

## Instructions

Please download and install: 
- PFUnit
  - For now this is mandatory but I plan to make it optional in case you do not wish to enable testing.
- JSON-Fortran
  - For now you must build this separately. Please make sure you select the right precision. At some point, I want to embed this into my project, but as a hacky temporary workaround, I'm going to just ask you to do it yourself. :)

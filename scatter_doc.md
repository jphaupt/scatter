Brief description
-----------------

Trying to learn MPI while also trying to be useful.

My main reason for choosing Fortran was because my current group uses it. It is
a nice language but unfortunately lacks a lot of support and can be quite
tedious to accomplish simple things as a result. I am using MPI for the same
reason. Otherwise I would be using Coarray Fortran.
